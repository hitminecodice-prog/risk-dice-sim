# Risk Dice Battle Simulator
A Python-based tool to simulate the outcome of dice rolls for the board game **Risk**
## About the Project
This is a simple script i made in a hour due to some struggle throwing dice on the table 
that was small and dices tend to fail since the map is massive and troops stacks and you can make a mess.
I also made this specifically for the task so it wont be a mess to see and i'm just a beginner currently so the code isn't much but 
does the task as intended, clean and fast
## Key Features
- **Flexible Troop Count:** You can put any number but it suggests 3 since the rules mainly says max is 3 but fee free to add any number
- **Dice Logic:** It sorts automatically from highest to lowest for both numbers so there wont be confusion
- **Detailed Output:** Displays each individual number so you will see each dice result
## How to Run
Ensure you have python3 installed and run it using any shell using python3 on the directory it is currently saved and then python3 RiskDice.py 
## Licensing

## Notes
I wanted to make this a small app in the future so you can run this in mobile or websites but you're free to create it as long you respect the license
